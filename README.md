# Heart-Disease-Patient-Preidiction-using-Unsupervised-and-supervised-learning

In this project we will classify patients of heart disease. We are using **Statlog heart data set** for this project. In this project we will apply different Machine Learning Algorithms to analyze the dataset. we will be apply following Machine Learning Algorithms:

- **Unsupversied Learning Algorithm**: Gaussian Mixture
- **Unsupversied Learning Algorithm**: K-Mean Clustering 
- **Supervised Learning Algorithm**: Decision Tree 
- **Supervised Learning Algorithm**: Suppor Vector Machine Classifier

## Dataset Description
This is a **Statlog Heat data set**. In this dataset we have 10 columns. In those 10 columns first 9 columns are features and the last one is class/target variable. In the dataset we have following features:

- **Age**: Age is a countinous variable.
- **Sex**: Sex is a binary viable (Male/Female).
- **Rest Blood Pressure**: Rest Blood Pressure is a continous variable.
- **Serum Cholestoral**: Serum Cholestoral is a continous variable.
- **Fasting Blood Sugar**: Fasting Blood Sugar is a binary variable.
- **Max Heart Rate**: Max Heart Rate is a continous variable.
- **Excercise Induced**: Excercise Induced is a binary variable.
- **Slope**: Slope is a continous variable.
- **Major Vessels**: Major Vessels is a continous variable.
- **Class**: This is target variable, if disease is **present then class label is 2**, if disease is **not present then class label is 1**
